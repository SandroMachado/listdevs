This is a simple script that can be used to list the devices an ipa file
has been signed to work against
to use:

./listdevs.sh <ipa file> <UDID>

If you dont provide a valid UDID the output will be a list of UDIDs that are contained in the embedded
mobileprovisioning file contained within the ipa
If you provide a valid UDID, the output will be the response if the UDID is in the mobileprovisioning or not
Enjoy
